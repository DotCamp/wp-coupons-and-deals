# [task-001]

> We need a shortcode that will show a coupon submission form on the frontend so that admins can let other users add coupons to their site. The form will include all the fields that's available in the dashboard while adding a coupon. While adding a new coupon, some of the fields are hidden and shown conditionally. We will have to include those too. We will also have to make sure we follow security guidelines while creating, saving the form data.


## goals
- OOP design
    - may look odd when compared with the current code base, but will make testing and future improvements much easier
- testing
    - for fast releases
- documentation
    - document everything for future developers
 
## roadmap/todos
seperating the task into three main subject

 - shortcode implementation
 - front-end form display
 - embedding coupons at other sites
