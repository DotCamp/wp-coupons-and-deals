WP Coupons and Deals is a Coupon plugin that lets you add coupons, deals to your posts, pages with a simple and beautiful shortcode.

You can also show coupons and deals on your sidebar or other widget areas using an widget.

You can create three types of coupon.

* Coupon
* Deal
* Image

The coupon shortcode comes with the functionality to **click to copy coupon**. That means when users click on the coupon code, the coupon code will be copied to clipboard.


When coupon is copied, a link is opened in a new tab. You can use your affiliate link here. So when users copy the coupon code, your affiliate link is opened in a new tab.
This way you can generate more sales from your coupon codes.

Deal shortcode looks the same as the coupon type. Only difference is instead of coupon code, a button is showed which can say anything you want, like - 'Get This Deal', 'Claim This Deal'.

Also, when users click on this button, nothing is copied. Only your link opens in a new tab.

With both the coupon types, a discount amount/text is shown on the left, so users immediately know what the coupon code/deal is about. Below the discount amount/text coupon type is shown i.e whether it is a coupon code or a deal.


Both coupon code/deal button shows a little tooltip text to make it more attractive. You can set what text is showed here.

Expiration date or text is shown on the right below the coupon code/deal button. If coupon/deal is expired, an expired message is shown. You can show your own text here.
If any coupon/deal doesn't expire, another text is shown. You can customize that too.

You can customize the date format of the expiration date. Make sure you update expiration date of your old coupons, otherwise the previous date format will be shown.

Now you can also show only the coupon code instead of the full coupon with details. You can select the shortcode type from the shortcode inserter.

Image coupons are just images. You can upload image of a coupon and give users the option to print the coupon.
